Problem Statement

Mental health is a crucial aspect of a student's well-being, and understanding the factors that affect it is of great importance. This repository addresses the problem of evaluating student mental health using the "Student Mental Health" dataset. The dataset provides valuable insights into students' characteristics, course details, and their mental health status, including depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.

Solution

To tackle the problem of evaluating student mental health, we have employed both logistic regression and linear regression models. Logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks, such as predicting whether a student is likely to have depression, anxiety, or panic attacks. Linear regression, on the other hand, is utilized for predicting numerical values, like a student's age.

The goal of this analysis is to better understand the factors that influence student mental health and provide insights that can be used to support students in educational environments.
